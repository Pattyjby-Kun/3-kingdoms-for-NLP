# 🏯 3-Kingdoms Analysis: Relationship Character using NLP

Welcome to **"3-Kingdoms Analysis Relationship Character"** —  
an NLP-based project that analyzes the relationships between characters in the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* novel.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to:
- 🧠 Extract **named entities** (characters, places, events)
- 🔗 Analyze **relationships** between characters based on co-occurrence and context
- 📊 Visualize the **relationship network** (who interacts with whom)
- 💬 Generate summaries or relationship insights automatically

---

## 🧩 Features

✅ Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
✅ Relationship Extraction using rule-based or ML methods  
✅ Visualization of character networks (Graph-based)  
✅ Data preprocessing and text cleaning pipeline  
✅ Output as JSON Form and Graph

---------------------------------------------------------

How to use basic
1.Fine some chapter of 3-kingdoms link or file(put in data and skip preprocessing)
2.run ner for analysis character
3.run relationship_extraction.py then you'll wait processing just a minutes
4.If finish processing go to output folder,You must found JSON file in chapter_relations_rulebased or graphs in graphs folder
